      Today, I learned about CSS setup, syntax, attributes, and selectors. I spent about an hour reading lessons and doing exercises in Codecademy's full stack program.
      I wish I had started this journal when I started the program back in April of this year but you know, better late than never. By writing down a reflection of what
      I learned, I hope that it'll help me look back one day and understand the progress I've made through my learning journey. I'd like to keep the logs as short as 
      possible... so that's it <em>for now</em>! -Jhas

        Hello GitHubbers! Two years have gone by fast and I've learned so many software development concepts and techniques since the last time I was here! 
        Let me tell you about how difficult it was learning everything from the basics like, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, some SQL, and then my favorite, Python.
        I'm about close to getting to my third year in earning my B.S. in C.S. and I'm more excited that I ever was when I started the program. My next class for
        this upcoming term will be <b>Introduction to Scripting, Single-variable Calculus</b> and <b>Foundation in Application Development</b>. I've also completed
        numerous Python, JavaScrip, and API projects which I've shared on here and LinkedIn, as well as my completion of JP Morgan Chase's Software Engineering Job
        Simulation through The Forage. Now, I've started Wells Fargo Software Engineering Job Sim through The Forage as well, and I'm super ecstatic about what new
        concepts I'll be learning. I'll keep working on projects almost every day to build on my skills and hopefully make a valuable change in the software development
        industry. Wish me luck! - Jhas
