- 👋 Hi, I’m @ninetails-us (Jhasmin Gambon) 
- 👀 I’m interested in video games like Animal Crossing or Monster Hunter, Subarus, tech, lofi music, traveling, and programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML and CSS as a student in the Full Stack Engineer path with Codecademy. I'm tackling down the front end first, and then back end.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will help me learn programming, more specifically Web Development at the moment.
